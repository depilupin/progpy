    "Prognostics involves two key steps: 1) state estimation and 2) prediction. [State estimation](https://nasa.github.io/progpy/prog_algs_guide.html#prog-algs-guide:~:text=to%20toe%20prediction.-,State%20Estimation,-%23) is the process of estimating the current state of the system using sensor data and a prognostics model. The result is an estimate of the current state of the system with uncertainty. This estimate can then used by the predictor to perform prediction of future states and events. In this section, we describe state estimation and the tools within ProgPy to implement it. \n",
    "\n",
    "State estimation is the process of estimating the internal model state (`x`) using the inputs, outputs, and parameters of the system. This is necessary for cases where the model state isn't directly measurable (i.e. *hidden states*), or where there is sensor noise in state measurements. \n",
    "\n",
    "The foundation of state estimators is the estimate method. The estimate method is called with a time, inputs, and outputs. Each time estimate is called, the internal state estimate is updated. For example: `state_estimator.estimate(time, inputs, outputs)`, then the resulting state can be accessed using the property x (i.e., `state_estimator.estimate .x`).\n",
    "\n",
    "ProgPy includes a number of [state estimators](https://nasa.github.io/progpy/api_ref/prog_algs/StateEstimator.html). The most common techniques include Kalman Filters and Particle Filters. Users can also define their own custom state estimators. Examples of each of these are presented below. "

    "One method for state estimation in ProgPy is using a [Kalman Filter (KF)](https://nasa.github.io/progpy/api_ref/prog_algs/StateEstimator.html#:~:text=Unscented%20Kalman%20Filter-,Kalman,-Filter). Kalman Filters are a simple, efficient state estimator for linear systems where state is represented by a mean and covariance matrix. The resulting state is represented by a [progpy.uncertain_data.MultivariateNormalDist](https://nasa.github.io/progpy/api_ref/progpy/UncertainData.html#progpy.uncertain_data.MultivariateNormalDist). Only works with Prognostic Models inheriting from [progpy.LinearModel](https://nasa.github.io/progpy/api_ref/progpy/LinearModel.html#progpy.LinearModel). "
