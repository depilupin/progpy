"""
This example performs a state estimation and prediction with uncertainty given a Prognostics Model with a specific prediction horizon. This prediction horizon marks the end of the "time of interest" for the prediction. Often this represents the end of a mission or sufficiently in the future where the user is unconcerned with the events

Method: An instance of the Thrown Object model in progpy is created, and the prediction process is achieved in three steps:
    1) State estimation of the current state is performed using a chosen state_estimator, and samples are drawn from this estimate
    2) Prediction of future states (with uncertainty) and the times at which the event thresholds will be reached, within the prediction horizon. All events outside the horizon come back as None and are ignored in metrics

Results:
    i) Predicted future values (inputs, states, outputs, event_states) with uncertainty from prediction
    ii) Time event is predicted to occur (with uncertainty)
