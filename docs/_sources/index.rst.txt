NASA's ProgPy is an open-sourced python package supporting research and development of prognostics and health management and predictive maintenance tools. It implements architectures and common functionality of prognostics, supporting researchers and practitioners. The ProgPy package is a combination of the original prog_models and prog_algs packages.

ProgPy documentation is split into three senctions described below.

* :ref:`Modeling and Simulation<Modeling and Sim Guide>` : defining, building, using, and testing models for prognostics
* :ref:`State Estimation and Prediction<State Estimation and Prediction Guide>` : performing and benchmarking prognostics and state estimation
* :ref:`prog_server<prog_server Guide>` and :ref:`prog_client<prog_server Guide>` : A simplified implementation of a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) for performing prognostics and associated client

Installing progpy
-----------------------

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: Stable Version (Recommended)

        The latest stable release of ProgPy is hosted on PyPi. For most users, this version will be adequate. To install via the command line, use the following command:

        .. code-block:: console

            $ pip install progpy

    .. tab:: Pre-Release

        Users who would like to contribute to ProgPy or would like to use pre-release features can do so using the `ProgPy GitHub repo <https://github.com/nasa/progpy>`__. This isn't recommended for most users as this version may be unstable. To do this, use the following commands:

        .. code-block:: console

            $ git clone https://github.com/nasa/progpy
            $ cd progpy
            $ git checkout dev 
            $ pip install -e .
