    Class for discrete state. Users wont be constructing this directly, but will instead be using the factory function create_discrete_state.

    This is an enum, so discrete states will be accessed directly. For example:
        DiscreteState.state_name
        DiscreteState(1)

    """
    .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

    Create a discrete state for use with a progpy model. Users construct a discrete state for the default x0 to make that state discrete.

    Args:
        n_states (int): Number of possible states.
        names (list[str], optional): Names for states. Defaults to using "State [#]" for each state (e.g., "State 1")
        transition ({function, str}, optional): Transition logic. Can be either a string ('random', 'none', or 'sequential') or a function (DiscreteState, float)->int of state and disruption to state number. Defaults to "random".

    Returns:
        DiscreteState class: Class to construct a discrete state

    Example:
        >>> Switch = create_discrete_state(2, ['on', 'off'])
        >>> x0['switch'] = Switch.off

    Example:
        >>> # Representing 'gear' of car
